# Module_1_Challenge
Below is a summary of what I did to accomplish the presented materials for Module 1 Challenge/Excel challenge:
Create a new space in Dropbox or Google Drive called "excel-challenge" specifically for this project. Do not add it to an existing repository. Store all Excel workbooks related to this project in this new space and create a sharable link for submission.

Download the provided files for the Module 1 Challenge to help you get started.

The dataset consists of a table with 1,000 sample crowdfunding projects.

Modify and analyze the sample-project data in Excel to uncover market trends.

Use conditional formatting to color cells in the "Outcome" column based on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, canceled, or currently live.

Create a new column called "Percent Funded" using a formula to calculate how much money a campaign made relative to its initial funding goal. Apply conditional formatting to color cells in the "Percent Funded" column based on a three-color scale.

Create a new column called "Average Donation" using a formula to find the average amount each project backer paid.

Split the "Category" and "Sub-Category" column into separate columns called "Parent Category" and "Sub-Category" using formulas.

Create a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzes the initial worksheet to count the number of successful, failed, canceled, and live campaigns per category. Create a stacked-column pivot chart based on this table, which can be filtered by country.

Create another sheet with a pivot table that analyzes the initial sheet to count the number of successful, failed, canceled, and live campaigns per sub-category. Create a stacked-column pivot chart based on this table, which can be filtered by country and parent category.

Convert the dates in the "deadline" and "launched_at" columns from Unix timestamps to Excel's date format by creating new columns called "Date Created Conversion" and "Date Ended Conversion" using the provided formulas.

Create a new sheet with a pivot table that shows the outcomes based on the launch date. The table should have columns for the outcome, rows for the date created conversion, values based on the count of outcomes, and filters based on parent category and years. Create a pivot-chart line graph to visualize this table.

Create a report in Microsoft Word to answer questions based on the data, including three conclusions about crowdfunding campaigns and limitations of the dataset. Additionally, propose other possible tables or graphs that could provide additional value.

Create a new sheet with eight columns for crowdfunding goal analysis. Set up goal ranges and calculate the number of successful, failed, and canceled projects within each range using the COUNTIFS() formula. Calculate the total number of projects and the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled projects per goal range. Create a line chart to illustrate the relationship between goal amount and project success, failure, or cancellation.

Create a new worksheet to analyze the number of backers for successful and unsuccessful campaigns. Calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, variance, and standard deviation for each group. Determine whether the mean or median better summarizes the data and analyze the variability between successful and unsuccessful campaigns.

Ensure all requirements are met, including applying conditional formatting, creating new columns, using pivot tables and stacked column charts, creating a written report, performing crowdfunding goal analysis, and conducting statistical analysis.
